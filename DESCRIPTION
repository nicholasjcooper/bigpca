Description: Provides PCA workflows, thinning helpers, and import utilities for
    the 'bigmemory' stack, enabling large scale principal component analysis on
    file-backed matrices. The package wraps native 'big.matrix' operations,
    offers custom IRLBA integrations, and includes pragmatic utilities for
    previewing and restructuring large matrices.
